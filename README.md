# Soulslike-Weaponry
Welcome to Soulslike Weaponry, a mod that started with 
me wondering how fun it would be to add the Moonlight 
Greatsword to Minecraft, which turned out to be a bigger 
project than I anticipated.

The wiki here will be up-to-date with the latest release, 
so keep in mind that older versions may not contain 
certain features.

The mod is highly configurable, you can always edit 
health of bosses, damage to weapons and other aspects
in the config (config/soulsweapons.json).
